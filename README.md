# Linear-Regression-on-Iris-Dataset
## Iris Linear Regression Model ðŸŒ¸
Welcome to the Iris Linear Regression Model repository! ðŸš€

### Overview:
This project showcases a linear regression model applied to the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset, containing features of iris flowers, becomes the canvas for predicting one of three flower species based on its characteristics.

### Dependencies:
Make sure you have following dependencies installed:<br>
- pandas<br>
- scikit learn<br>
- numpy<br>

Check if they are installed:<br>
pip show pandas scikit-learn numpy

If not installed, run the following commands in the terminal:<br>
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy

### Features:
- **Dataset Conversion:** Utilize pandas to convert the Iris dataset into pandas DataFrames for efficient data manipulation.

- **Data Splitting:** Employ scikit-learn to split the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring a robust evaluation of the model.

- **Model Creation:** Develop a linear regression model using scikit-learn, tapping into its powerful machine learning capabilities.

- **Model Fitting:** Train the linear regression model by fitting it to the training data, allowing it to capture patterns and relationships.

- **Model Training:** Leverage scikit-learn's linear regression module to train the model, guiding it through the intricacies of the Iris dataset.

- **Model Prediction:** Unleash the trained model on the test data, predicting iris species with a touch of machine learning magic.

- **Mean Squared Error Calculation:** Gauge the model's performance by calculating the Mean Squared Error, a metric providing insights into prediction accuracy.

- **DataFrame Creation:** Construct a pandas DataFrame to elegantly display actual and predicted values alongside corresponding flower types, enhancing result visualization.
